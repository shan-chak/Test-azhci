# HPE Automated Solution for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) on HPE ProLiant DL Servers

# Solution Overview
<p align="justify">HPE automated solution for VMware® Cloud Foundation™ (VCF) delivers a validated configuration for VCF installation on HPE Synergy Composable Infrastructure & HPE ProLiant DL3x0 servers with vSAN, HPE Primera and Nimble as principal and supplementary storages using Aruba Networking. It simplifies VCF solution bring-up on HPE ProLiant & Synergy with pre-validated design-based infrastructure automation, seamless scalable operations and with built-in lifecycle automation via vLCM and vRO workflows.
  
HPE automation tools include SSET (Solution Sales Enablement Toolkit), Smart CID (Smart Customer Intent Document) and SAT (Solution Automation Toolkit). SSET provides sizing guidance and SmartCID collects customer inputs for the VCF bring up. SAT builds the HPE ProLiant DL3x0 with vSAN storage, HPE Primera and Aruba Networking. SAT also supports automated build for HPE Synergy with vSAN, Primera and Nimble storage as per best practices while bringing up VCF management and workload domains. VCF consolidated architecture is demonstrated to target smaller VCF deployment use cases. vLCM and OneView for vRealize Orchestrator workflows are also demonstrated for automated HPE ProLiant DL3x0 firmware updates.
  
With these new HPE automation tools, customers and partners can now build end-to-end validated solution with confidence and achieve faster time-to-value with a ‘first time right’ approach.
